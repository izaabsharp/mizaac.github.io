<h2>Computer Science Major</h2>
<h3>Bob Jones University</h3>
<p>	
	My name is Izaac Morales, and I am a student at 
	<a href="http://www.bju.edu">Bob Jones University</a>. 
	In May of this year, I graduated with a BMus in Keyboard Performance,
	and I now am pursuing a second degree in Computer Science. While I am
	working on completing this degree, I also work for the university in 
	a Graduate Assistant position. My position is Guard Supervisor for the 
	<a href="http://www.bjumg.org/">Museum & Gallery</a> 
	which houses the Bob Jones University art collection.
	I both supervise our student guards and act as security for the Gallery.
	Balancing both school and work has its challenges, but it is and will be 
	well worth all the hard work.

	I did not grow up in Greenville. This year marks my fifth in the state
	of South Carolina. Even though I've been here for a good bit of my life
	now, I actually grew up in 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii">Hawaii</a>
	on the island of Kauai. Both of my parents moved there from other 
	regions of the world, and our family has been there ever since. I was 
	the first to move off the island, and I am enjoying what time I have 
	spent off it since I had been there 18 straight years previously. 
	Variety is always good for the human spirit.
